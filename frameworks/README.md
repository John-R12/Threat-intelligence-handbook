# 🧩 Threat Intelligence Frameworks

This folder contains documentation and references for **CTI frameworks and standards**.  
Frameworks help structure intelligence activities, provide common terminology, and support **threat analysis, mapping, and sharing**.

---

## 🧭 Objectives

- Provide a **structured approach** for collecting, analyzing, and sharing threat intelligence.  
- Align internal processes with recognized **standards and frameworks**.  
- Facilitate **threat actor profiling, TTP mapping, and incident response**.  
- Support operational decision-making with consistent models.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Use **MITRE ATT&CK** for TTP mapping and threat actor profiling.  
2. Apply the **Diamond Model** to structure incident analysis and investigations.  
3. Leverage the **Cyber Kill Chain** to understand adversary campaign stages.  
4. Follow **CTI Standards** to ensure interoperability and automated sharing.  
5. Combine frameworks for **holistic threat intelligence analysis**.
