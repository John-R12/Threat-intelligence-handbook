# 🧠 Threat Intelligence Analysis

This folder contains documents and guides for **analyzing collected threat data**.  
Analysis transforms raw or enriched data into **actionable intelligence** that supports detection, response, and decision-making.

---

## 🧩 Objectives

- Identify patterns, correlations, and trends across indicators.  
- Profile threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).  
- Track campaigns and map indicators to operational context.  
- Support SOC, IR, and threat hunting activities.
