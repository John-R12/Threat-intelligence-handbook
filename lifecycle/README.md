# 🔄 Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

The **Threat Intelligence Lifecycle** defines the continuous process of transforming raw data into actionable intelligence.  
It ensures that intelligence activities are **structured, repeatable, and aligned** with organizational objectives.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The lifecycle typically follows six key phases:

1. **Direction & Planning** – Define goals, scope, and intelligence requirements.  
2. **Collection** – Gather data from various sources (open, commercial, internal).  
3. **Processing** – Normalize, clean, and structure data for analysis.  
4. **Analysis & Production** – Identify patterns, assess threats, and generate reports.  
5. **Dissemination** – Deliver intelligence to relevant stakeholders.  
6. **Feedback & Review** – Evaluate the effectiveness and refine requirements.

## ⚙️ Best Practices

- Maintain **traceability** between requirements, data, and outputs.  
- Automate **collection and enrichment** where possible.  
- Ensure **feedback loops** exist between producers and consumers of intelligence.  
- Continuously **refine priorities** based on evolving threats and feedback.
