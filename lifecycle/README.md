# 🔄 Cyber Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

This folder contains the core documents describing the **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) lifecycle**, including templates and practical methods for collection, analysis, and dissemination.

The CTI lifecycle ensures that intelligence activities are **structured, repeatable, and actionable**.

---

## 🧩 Lifecycle Overview

The main stages of the lifecycle are:

1. **Intelligence Cycle Overview** – general description of CTI processes.  
2. **Collection Planning** – templates and guidance for planning collection activities.  
3. **Analysis Methods** – techniques and best practices for analyzing threat data.  
4. **Dissemination & Feedback** – sharing intelligence effectively and capturing feedback for continuous improvement.
