# 🧠 Threat Intelligence Handbook

The **Threat Intelligence Handbook** provides a structured, practical guide for building and operating a **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** capability.  
It is designed for analysts, SOCs, CERTs, and defenders who want to collect, analyze, and apply intelligence effectively.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository helps you:
- Understand and apply the **Threat Intelligence lifecycle**.
- Identify and evaluate intelligence sources (open, dark, commercial).
- Analyze indicators, adversary campaigns, and TTPs.
- Share intelligence securely and efficiently (STIX, TAXII, TLP).
- Enrich and score data to improve operational value.
